# Chimborazo Park Conservancy

> A 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to preserving and enhancing Chimborazo Park in Richmond, Virginia's Church Hill neighborhood through community stewardship.

The Chimborazo Park Conservancy (also known as Friends of Chimborazo Park) was founded in 2023 to restore, maintain, and improve Chimborazo Park — a historic 33-acre public park located at 3215 E. Broad Street, Richmond, VA. The park features sweeping bluff-top views of downtown Richmond and the James River, historic structures, woodland trails, and community gathering spaces.
