Join us for our annual Spring Clean-up event at Chimborazo Park! This is a wonderful opportunity to give back to our community and help maintain the beauty of our historic park.

## What to Expect

We'll be working together to:

- Clear winter debris from trails and green spaces
- Rake leaves and remove fallen branches
- Tidy up flower beds and planting areas
- Pick up litter throughout the park
- Prepare the park for the spring and summer seasons

## What to Bring

- Work gloves (we'll have extras if you forget)
- Water bottle to stay hydrated
- Sunscreen and hat for sun protection
- Comfortable clothes that can get dirty
- Your community spirit!

## Coffee & Refreshments

We'll provide coffee, snacks, and refreshments throughout the morning. After we wrap up, stick around to connect with fellow volunteers and neighbors.
