Help us grow Chimborazo Park's tree canopy! Join the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Chimborazo Park Conservancy for a community tree planting event during Richmond Tree Week.

## Event Overview

We'll be planting native trees throughout Chimborazo Park to enhance the urban forest, improve air quality, and create habitat for local wildlife. No experience necessaryâ€”we'll provide all the training and tools you need.

## What We're Planting

This planting focuses on native species that thrive in Richmond's climate:

- **Oak species** - Providing long-term shade and wildlife habitat
- **Tulip Poplar** - Fast-growing Virginia native
- **Sweetgum** - Excellent fall color and wildlife value
- **Red Maple** - Adaptable and beautiful year-round
- **Eastern Redbud** - Spring flowering understory tree
