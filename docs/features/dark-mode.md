# Dark Mode

The Chimborazo Park Conservancy website supports dark mode to reduce eye strain and respect user preferences.

## How It Works

The site offers three theme modes:

- **Light**: Forces light theme regardless of system preference
- **Dark**: Forces dark theme regardless of system preference
- **System**: Automatically matches your operating system's theme preference (default)

## Changing Theme

1. Click the **Menu** button in the header
2. Look for the theme toggle (shows sun, moon, or monitor icon)
3. Click to cycle through: Light → Dark → System

Your preference is saved and will persist across visits.

## System Preference

If you select "System" mode (monitor icon), the site will automatically:
- Match your OS theme when you first visit
- Update immediately when you change your OS theme
- Sync across multiple tabs/windows

## Browser Support

Dark mode works in all modern browsers that support:
- CSS custom properties
- localStorage
- `prefers-color-scheme` media query

## Accessibility

The dark theme maintains WCAG AA contrast ratios for readability. All interactive elements remain clearly visible in both themes.
